# 2023

It's been almost 5 years since I wrote this website and I've come to revisit it to dust off the cobwebs.
And boy it is some real spaghetti code.
Where do I start?
+ Long if statement chains
+ Unneccesarily lines of code
+ Generally odd decisons
+ Bizzarre formatting

I took a moment to rewrite (and bug fix) the worst part of clock.js, (which I believe predates this site itself), since it's pretty self contained. One day I'll take the time to refactor the entire website, and when I do, I would probably rewrite it using a modern framework. But it serves as a good reminder of where I came from and how far I've come. Cheers to future learning.
